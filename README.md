My CS50 SQL final project involves developing a database designed to manage key aspects of the UNSTPB university administration. The database includes essential entities:

The database supports:

- Students: Basic identifying information.
- Professors: Basic identifying information.
- Faculties: Name, location, and foundational details.
- Sponsoring Companies: Background information.
- Classes: Name, location, and related details.
- Dining Halls: Name, location, and associated faculty.
- Courses: Names and related IDs.
- Events: Names and related IDs.

The database handles three types of enrollments too:

- Students by faculty.
- Students by courses.
- Students by events.
  
**Out of scope**: Faculty enrollment, professor roles, faculty changes, and event management.
